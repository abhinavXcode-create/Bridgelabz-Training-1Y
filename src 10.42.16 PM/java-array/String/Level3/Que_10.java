/*Write a program to create a deck of cards, initialize the deck, shuffle the deck, and distribute
the deck of n cards to x number of players. Finally, print the cards the players have.
Hint =>
a. Create a deck of cards with suits "Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades" and ranks
from "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King", and "Ace"
b. Calculate the number of cards in the deck and initialize the deck
int numOfCards = suits.length * ranks.length;
c. Write a Method to Initialize the deck of cards with suits and ranks and return the deck.
The deck is an array of strings where each string represents a card in the deck
represented as "rank of suit" e.g., "2 of Hearts"
d. Write a Method to Shuffle the deck of cards and return the shuffled deck. To shuffle the
card iterate over the deck and swap each card with a random card from the remaining
deck to shuffle the deck. Please find the steps below
Step1: Use for Loop Iterate over the deck and swap each card with a random card from
the remaining deck
Step 2: Inside the Loop Generate a random card number between i and n using the
following code
int randomCardNumber = i + (int) (Math.random() * (n - i));
Step 3: Swap the current card with the random card
e. Write a Method to distribute the deck of n cards to x number of players and return the
players. For this Check the n cards can be distributed to x players. If possible then
Create a 2D array to store the players and their cards
f. Write a Method to Print the players and their cards */
